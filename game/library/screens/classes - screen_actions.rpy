    Alex: Why is all of this required? I cannot (yet) seen an advantage to writing any of these conditions to strings and evaluate those strings as/when needed.
    While that is possible also, it makes everything else redundant.
    
    @Review: I think that I've finally figured out what this is for, eval is usually not a very good idea in a sense that it can be slow.
    This is a better bet for most conditioning. Basically the advantage is speed...

    # 
    # Iff is used to hold and solve an if statement later, instead of immediately.
    #     c = Iff(myvar, ">", 7)
    # 
    # This will check that myvar is above 7.
    # The problem is that the value of myvar will be stored at initialisation and never looked up again.
    # This means that the Iff instance is functionally the same as:
    #     c = myvar > 7
    # 
    # To solve this, we use a class called S.
    # Example:
    #     p = S((mycontainer, "myvar"))
    # 
    # S is a deleyed getattr call, similar to how Iff is a delayed if statement. S however, can do more then getattr.
    #     S((mycontainer, "myvar")) == getattr(mycontainer, "myvar") == mycontainer.myvar
    #     
    #     S((mycontainer, "myfunc", a)) == getattr(mycontainer, "myfunc")(a) == mycontainer.myfunc(a)
    # 
    # If the value reached by S is callable (say myvar holds an object with a __call__ function) then the result of value() will be returned instead.
    # To prevent this, you can return the function in a single-length tuple and its contents will be used as the value, but won't be called.
    # 
    # S can also be used to solve sums (in a left-to-right order, anything more complex should be passed as a function):
    #     S((mycontainer, "myvar"), "+", 7) == getattr(mycontainer, "myvar") + 7 == mycontainer.myvar + 7
    #     
    #     S((mycontainer, "myvar"), "+", (mycontainer, "myother")) == getattr(mycontainer, "myvar") + getattr(mycontainer, "myother") == mycontainer.myvar + mycontainer.myother
    # 
    # S can use the following operators:
    #     +, -, *, **(power), /, //(integer division), %, /%(divmod),
    #     in, not in, is, ===, is not, !==,
    #     ==, eq, !=, ne, >, gt, >=, =>, ge, <, lt, <=, le
    # 
    # Finally, as S thinks of tuples/lists as a stored getattr, they will always attempt to interpret lists/tuples. To get around this wrap the iterable in a single length tuple:
    #     S((mylist,))
    # 
    # You can easily create S's for global_flags and properties in the renpy store using:
    #     global_flag_complex("flagname")
    #     renpy_store_complex("propertyname")
    # 
    # Both the property and value of Iff's can be S instances.
    # 
    # Iff can use the following operators:
    #     ==, eq, ===, is, !=, ne, !==, is not, >, gt, >=, =>, ge, <, lt, <=, le, in, not in
    # 
    # 
    # If you want Iff's or S's to be valid expressions for variables in other classes / uses, you should solve them using the solution function.
    #     solution(myiff)
    #       or
    #     solution(mys)
    # 
    # solution always return a boolean, by following the following rules:
    #     Any single-length tuple will have its sole index be cast to bool.
    #         bool(tuple[0])
    #     
    #     Any list or tuple with >1 indexes has all its indexes solved recursively.
    #         all([solution(i) for i in statement])

    #     
    #     Everything else will be cast to bool and returned.
    #         bool(statement)
